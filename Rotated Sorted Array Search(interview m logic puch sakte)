Given an array of integers A of size N and an integer B.

array A is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7  might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2 ).

You are given a target value B to search. If found in the array, return its index, otherwise return -1.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

NOTE:- Array A was sorted in non-decreasing order before rotation.

NOTE : Think about the case when there are duplicates. Does your current solution work? How does the time complexity change?*
